    SerDes
        Serializer/deserializer, is an integrated circuit (IC or chip) transceiver 
        that converts parallel data to serial data and vice versa 

    SFP 
        Small form-factor pluggable (SFP) transceivers are a core technology in 
        many networks, providing communication between switches and important 
        network components. SFPâ€™s are popular due to their small size, versatile 
        connection options (copper or fiber optic), and hot swappable capability.

    SGMII
        Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interfaces.
        SGMII supports a single 10M/100M/1G network port over 1,25Gbps SERDES 
        between MAC and PHY, while QSGMII supports four 10M/100M/1G network 
        ports over 5Gbps SERDES between MAC and PHY.
        
    QSGMII
        The quad serial gigabit media-independent interface (QSGMII) is a 
        method of combining four SGMII lines into a 5 Gbit/s interface. 
        QSGMII, like SGMII, uses low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) 
        for the TX and RX data, and a single LVDS clock signal.
    
    1000BASE-LX 
        1000BASE-LX is a gigabit Ethernet standard over fiber optic. It is for operating 
        on single mode fiber (SMF) or multimode fiber (MMF), with a long 
        wavelength of 1270 to 1355 nanometers (typically 1310nm). 
        The ``LX`` stands for long reach. 

    1000BASE-SX
        1000BASE-SX is a gigabit Ethernet standard over fiber optic. It is used 
        for operating on multimode fiber with a short wavelength of 770 to 860 
        nanometers (typically 850nm). 
        The ``SX`` stands for **short reach over multimode fiber**

    1000BASE-FX
        No standards define 1000BASE-FX, but some media converter vendors call 
        it gigabit ethernet (1000BASE) over fiber (FX). So we can see 
        1000BASE-SX, 1000BASE-LX, 1000BASE-EX, and 1000BASE-ZX variants 
        of 1000BASE-FX.
